# Suggestion Generation Services - Improvement Todos

## Overview
The suggestion generation system consists of multiple upstream services that need significant reliability and performance improvements. Current issues include LLM timeouts, service chain failures, and lack of fallback mechanisms.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### **Service Dependencies**
```
NoteLinkingService â†’ LinkingSuggestionIntegrationService â†’ SuggestionManagementService â†’ IntelligenceBrokerService (LLM)
```

### **Critical Issues Identified**
- **Synchronous chain**: All services must succeed for completion
- **LLM blocking**: AI processing blocks rule-based linking
- **No circuit breakers**: Failed services cascade failures
- **Timeout issues**: Long LLM calls block entire queue
- **Error propagation**: Upstream failures kill downstream processing

## Service-Specific Improvement Todos

### ðŸ¤– **IntelligenceBrokerService (LLM Service)**

#### **High Priority - Reliability**
- [ ] **Add timeout configuration**
  ```typescript
  interface LLMConfig {
    requestTimeout: number; // Default: 30 seconds
    maxRetries: number; // Default: 3
    retryDelay: number; // Default: 1000ms
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Implement circuit breaker pattern**
  ```typescript
  class CircuitBreaker {
    private failures: number = 0;
    private isOpen: boolean = false;
    private readonly threshold = 5;
    private readonly resetTimeout = 60000; // 1 minute
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Add request queuing with priority**
  - High priority: Real-time user requests
  - Medium priority: Background enhancement

  ```

  - Queue suggestions for background application
  - Non-blocking suggestion generation

    try {
      return await this.processFullEnhancement(notePath);
    } catch (error) {
      return await this.processRuleBasedOnly(notePath);
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Add processing stages**
  - Stage 1: Rule-based linking (always succeeds)
  - Stage 2: LLM enhancement (optional)
  - Stage 3: Suggestion generation (background)

- [ ] **Implement status tracking**
  ```typescript
  interface ProcessingStatus {
    stage: 'rule-based' | 'llm-enhancement' | 'suggestion-generation';
    progress: number; // 0-100
    error?: string;
    partialResults?: any;
  }
  ```
